# Hangman

Takes user input to read through word. User will either a. Fail after 10 incorrect choices OR b. Complete the word and have their total number of guesses shown in the final output.

Current version just takes hardcoded word. Plan for next iterations is to pull 4 letter words from a dataset to randomly assign a word to the variable. Later interations will provide options for words of varying lengths.

Further plans also include implemenation of pandas to create a "leaderboard" that inserts completed game's data to table, then will return the top 10 scores per total guesses.

Once all previously mentioned additions are added and workly properly, will add framework to create user-friendly environment to play game in.
